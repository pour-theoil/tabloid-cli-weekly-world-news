# Tabloid CLI

## Purpose

Using the SCRUM management technique this group project was our first major example of an implementation of C# and MS SQL. Are task was to take an existing console app with limited functionality and build out the remaining repository and manager classes to reach full functionality. As a team we delegated specify stories in the initial phase of the sprint coming together to review code and solve any issues that would arise. After completing our initial commitment we took a mob coding approach to solve some additional challenge problems. Including persisting a background color change as well as allowing the user to scroll through the different journal entries.


## How to run

Clone the repo in a directory of your choosing. Using a local sql express database start a new query and execute the ``TabloidCLI.sql`` code. The application can be run in the console from the Tabliod CLI directory with a ``dotnet run`` or using the built in console in Visual Studio 2019
